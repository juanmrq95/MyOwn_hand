# Summary

UPDATE, 4/3/2015: Updated finger snap pins (DistalPins2 [x1.stl) for tighter fit. Replaced the gauntlet with new parts, now called "Bracers". Five different shapes of bracer are available (type A-E).

UPDATE, 3/30/2015: Updated distal phalanges to include stronger tie-off bars.

UPDATE, 11/1/2014 : The elastic tie-off bars have been removed. The elastics now tie-off at the upper rear portion of the palm, right above where the non-flexible cords feed through to the tensioner pins. See photos for details.

We are very pleased to introduce the Raptor Hand by e-NABLE, designed collaboratively by some of e-NABLE’s top designers!   
The Raptor Hand is intended to bring together the best and most widely tested ideas from a year of crowd sourced innovation.   
   
The objectives in designing the Raptor Hand were as follows:  
- To simplify fabrication and assembly and repair for makers and recipients alike  
- To provide a platform and reference design for future innovations, incremental and radical  
- To identify a core features set and standardized dimensions embodied in accessible 3D models with progressive licensing terms that will ensure widespread availability and future development.   
   
e-NABLE's prior "go to" designs included the Cyborg Beast, the Talon hand, the Ody hand and the Talon Beast. To these classics, the Raptor Hand by e-NABLE adds the following features:  
- Easier and quicker printing (no supports required)  
- Easier and quicker assembly (no Chicago Screws required, simplified cord installation)  
- An improved tensioning system (modular design, allowing for easier future development)  
- Improved documentation (coming soon)  
  
All of the parts needed for assembly can be found easily in most areas, but if you prefer to get everything in one place, 3D Universe offers kits with all of the assembly materials needed for producing a Raptor Hand: http://shop3duniverse.com/collections/3d-printable-kits/products/raptor-hand-by-e-nable-assembly-materials-kit

# Instructions

Printing instructions:  
- Scale all parts as needed (the Raptor Hand is designed to work at scales from 100% through 170%)  
- At 100%, the inside of the palm area measures 55mm  
- Measure across the widest part of the palm, then add 5mm for padding, then divide by 55 to get the scaling factor (for example, if the palm is 65mm wide, then 65 + 5 = 70, and 70 / 55 = 1.27 - so your scaling multiplier would be 1.27 or 127%)  
- Print without supports (palm and gauntlet have some supports built into the model)  
- PLA is recommended  
Suggested settings are 0.2mm layer height, 35% infill, 2 outlines  
- Refer to file names for part descriptions. The number in square brackets at the end of each file name indicates how many copies of that STL file need to be printed for a complete hand assembly.  
  
A video tutorial for the assembly process can be found here: http://youtu.be/5HVwC3RnWXk  
  
Assembling a Raptor Hand requires the following materials:  
(4 feet) Velcro, double-sided (2” wide)  
(8 feet) Non-flexible nylon cord, 0.9mm  
(5 feet) Flexible elastic cord  
(5) Tensioner screws   
(3) Palm velcro attachment screws with stop nuts  
(12 inches) Firm Foam Padding (5 ¾” wide)  
(5) Lee Tippi Micro Gel Fingertip Grips (as shown in photo, optional)
